Over breaks in my home state of Washington one of my favorite vacation activities is clamming along the coastline. No, it's not that I particularly like getting cold and wet - but I do like to reap the delicious reward. Below is my home recipe for preparing some great clam chowder.

Recipe #1: Clam Chowder
=================================================================
<b>Ingredients in order of use:</b>
<br>Bacon (the more the better :3)
<br>Onions (preferably white so that the chowder stays white)
<br>Celery (a couple stalks - not too many or it tastes too strong)
<br>Butter (about 1 tbsp for each onion)
<br>Flour (about 2 tbsp for each tbsp of butter used)
<br>Potatos  (about 2 potatos for every onion)
<br>Clams - or more specifically clam juice (just have some so you get some umami)
<br>Heavy Whipping Cream  (about 2 potatos for every onion)
<br>Pepper (to taste)
<br>Salt (to taste)

<b>Procedure:</b>
<br>1.) Cook diced bacon in large pot. Render out the fat from the bacon. Scoop out cooked bacon and place aside to use later.
<br>2.) Added diced onions and celery to the bacon fat. Cook until onions and celery become translucent. 
<br>3.) Add butter to the veggies and slowly mix in the flour. Cook until the flour coats the veggies.
<br>4.) Dice potatos and add them to the pot. Pour in about 4 cups of water/clam juice for each onion. Let simmer for 30 min - 1 hr.  
5.) Once the chowder starts to thicken, add in the heavy whipping cream. 
<br>6.) Add salt and pepper to taste. 
<br>7.) Eat clam chowder :3

This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Pygments, for sytanx highlighting. It supports more than 100 languages. This example is in C++. All you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag: 
{% raw  %}
{% highlight c++ %}  <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}{% endraw %}

Produces something like this: 

{% highlight c++ %}

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	string myString;

	cout << "input a string: ";
	getline(cin, myString);
	int length = myString.length();
	
	char charArray = new char * [length];

	charArray = myString;
	for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
		cout << charArray[i] << " ";
	}
	
	return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}
