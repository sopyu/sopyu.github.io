[Cong You Bing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cong_you_bing) or Green Onion Pancakes was one of the yummiest (and easiest!) treats from my childhood. My personal recipe for one of my favorite foods is here for all posterity!

Recipe #2: Cong You Bing (Green Onion Pancakes)
=================================================================
<b>Ingredients for the dough:</b>
<br>300 g flour
<br>125 g boiling water
<br>100 g cold water

<b>Ingredients for the filling:</b>
<br>Two bunches of green onions
<br>Oil (enough to coat green onions)
<br>Salt to taste

<b>Procedure for the dough:</b>
<br>1.) Put flour in a large bowl. Add boiling water to the flour and mix  quickly to create a very flakey dough.
<br>2.) Then, add cold water and knead the dough for several minutes. This should result in extremely sticky dough. 
<br>3.) Let the dough rest for an hour. Make sure to cover with plastic wrap or a lid of some sort so that the dough does not dry out.

<b>Procedure for the green onion filling:</b>
<br>1.) Chop green onions finely and place into a bowl. 
<br>2.) Add enough oil to gently coat green onions. 
<br>3.) Add salt to taste. 
<br>4.) Let the green onion mixture sit for around 30 min.

<b>Combining the two and cooking:</b>
<br>1.) Take a handful of dough and spread it thinly across a flat surface until you get a somewhat rectangular shape. Use flour to keep it from sticking everywhere.
<br>2.) Spread the green onion mixture on top of the flattened dough. 
<br>3.) Roll the long edge of the dough upwards until you get a cylindrical dough/green onion snake :3
<br>4.) Roll the snake up into a cinnamon roll looking shape.
<br>5.) Let the rolled up dough sit for 30 min (just keep rolling them, the first one will be done when you finish the last one). 
<br>6.) Coat a pan with oil, turn the heat up high and place a roll in the center.
<br>7.) Flatten out the roll with a spatula to get a pancake shape as you fry.
<br>8.) Flip the pancake when the edges turn a golden brown.
<br>9.) Cook until the second side is also a golden brown.
<br>10.) Enjoy the delicious green onion pancake :D
