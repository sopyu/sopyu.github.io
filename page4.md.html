                           What could go wrong?


So here I plan to store some recipes, some cooking failures and a dash of rare success...

Recipe #2: Clam Chowder
=================================================================
Ingredients in order of use:
<br>Bacon (the more the better :3)
<br>Onions (preferably white so that the chowder stays white)
<br>Celery (a couple stalks - not too many or it tastes too strong)
<br>Butter (about 1 tbsp for each onion)
<br>Flour (about 2 tbsp for each tbsp of butter used)
<br>Potatos  (about 2 potatos for every onion)
<br>Clams - or more specifically clam juice (just have some so you get some umami)
<br>Heavy Whipping Cream  (about 2 potatos for every onion)
<br>Pepper (to taste)
<br>Salt (to taste)

Procedure:
<br>1.) Cook diced bacon in large pot. Render out the fat from the bacon. Scoop out cooked bacon and place aside to use later.
<br>2.) Added diced onions and celery to the bacon fat. Cook until onions and celery become translucent. 
<br>3.) Add butter to the veggies and slowly mix in the flour. Cook until the flour coats the veggies.
<br>4.) Dice potatos and add them to the pot. Pour in about 4 cups of water/clam juice for each onion. Let simmer for 30 min - 1 hr.  
<br>5.) Once the chowder starts to thicken, add in the heavy whipping cream. 
<br>6.) Add salt and pepper to taste. 
<br>7.) Eat clam chowder :3


Recipe #1: Cong You Bing (Green Onion Pancakes)
=================================================================
Ingredients for the dough:
<br>300g flour
<br>125g boiling water
<br>100g cold water

Ingredients for the filling:
<br>Two bunches of green onions
<br>Oil (enough to coat green onions)
<br>Salt to taste

Procedure for the dough:
<br>1.) Put flour in a large bowl. Add boiling water to the flour and mix  quickly to create a very flakey dough.
<br>2.) Then, add cold water and knead the dough for several minutes. This should result in extremely sticky dough. 
<br>3.) Let the dough rest for an hour. Make sure to cover with plastic wrap or a lid of some sort so that the dough does not dry out.

Procedure for the green onion filling:
<br>1.) Chop green onions finely and place into a bowl. 
<br>2.) Add enough oil to gently coat green onions. 
<br>3.) Add salt to taste. 
<br>4.) Let the green onion mixture sit for around 30 min.

Combining the two and cooking:
<br>1.) Take a handful of dough and spread it thinly across a flat surface until you get a somewhat rectangular shape. Use flour to keep it from sticking everywhere.
<br>2.) Spread the green onion mixture on top of the flattened dough. 
<br>3.) Roll the long edge of the dough upwards until you get a cylindrical dough/green onion snake :3
<br>4.) Roll the snake up into a cinnamon roll looking shape.
<br>5.) Let the rolled up dough sit for 30 min (just keep rolling them, the first one will be done when you finish the last one). 
<br>6.) Coat a pan with oil, turn the heat up high and place a roll in the center.
<br>7.) Flatten out the roll with a spatula to get a pancake shape as you fry.
<br>8.) Flip the pancake when the edges turn a golden brown.
<br>9.) Cook until the second side is also a golden brown.
<br>10.) Enjoy the delicious green onion pancake :D
