Recipe #1: Cong You Bing (Green Onion Pancakes)
=================================================================
Ingredients for the dough:
300g flour
125g boiling water
100g cold water

Ingredients for the filling:
Two bunches of green onions
Oil (enough to coat green onions)
Salt to taste

Procedure for the dough:
1.) Put flour in a large bowl. Add boiling water to the flour and mix  quickly to create a very flakey dough.
2.) Then, add cold water and knead the dough for several minutes. This should result in extremely sticky dough. 
3.) Let the dough rest for an hour. Make sure to cover with plastic wrap or a lid of some sort so that the dough does not dry out.

Procedure for the green onion filling:
1.) Chop green onions finely and place into a bowl. 
2.) Add enough oil to gently coat green onions. 
3.) Add salt to taste. 
4.) Let the green onion mixture sit for around 30 min.

Combining the two and cooking:
1.) Take a handful of dough and spread it thinly across a flat surface until you get a somewhat rectangular shape. Use flour to keep it from sticking everywhere.
2.) Spread the green onion mixture on top of the flattened dough. 
3.) Roll the long edge of the dough upwards until you get a cylindrical dough/green onion snake :3
4.) Roll the snake up into a cinnamon roll looking shape.
5.) Let the rolled up dough sit for 30 min (just keep rolling them, the first one will be done when you finish the last one). 
6.) Coat a pan with oil, turn the heat up high and place a roll in the center.
7.) Flatten out the roll with a spatula to get a pancake shape as you fry.
8.) Flip the pancake when the edges turn a golden brown.
9.) Cook until the second side is also a golden brown.
10.) Enjoy the delicious green onion pancake :D
